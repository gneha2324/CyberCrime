<h2>SOCIAL MEDIA CRIMES</h2>
				<!--<h3>Cyber Crime Cells in Delhi Police</h3>-->
				<p>More and more people, regardless of age and gender, are signing up for profiles on online social networks for connecting with each other in 
				this virtual world. Some have hundreds or thousands of friends and followers spread across multiple profiles. But at the same time there is proliferation
				of fake profiles also. Fake profiles often spam legitimate users, posting inappropriate or illegal content. 
				Fake profiles are also created while misrepresenting some known person to cause harassment to him/her.  </h3>
				<p>The most common targeted websites/apps for creating ‘Fake Profiles’ are as under: </p>
				<p>1. Facebook</p>
				<p>2. Instagram</p>
                <p>3. Twitter</p>
                <p>4. LinkedIn</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>Below are the common crimes being committed on or as a result of Social Media:-</p>
				<p>1. Online Threats, Stalking, Cyber bullying</p>
				<p>The most commonly reported and seen crimes that occur on social media involve people making threats, bullying, harassing, 
				and stalking others online. While much of this type of activity goes unpunished, or isn't taken seriously, victims of these 
				types of crimes frequently don't know when to call the police. If you feel threatened by a statement made online about you, 
				or believe that the threat is credible, it's probably a good idea to consider calling the police.</p>
				<br>
				<p>2. Hacking and Fraud</p>
				<p>Although logging into a friend's social media account to post an embarrassing status message may be acceptable between friends, 
				but technically, can be a serious crime. Additionally, creating fake accounts, or impersonation accounts, to trick people 
				(as opposed to just remaining anonymous), can also be punished as fraud depending on the actions the fake/impersonation account holder takes.</p>
			    <br>
				<p>3. Buying Illegal Things</p>
			    <p>Connecting over social media to make business connections, or to buy legal goods or services may be perfectly legitimate. However, connecting over 
				social media to buy drugs, or other regulated, controlled or banned products is probably illegal.</p>
				<br>
			    <p>4. Vacation Robberies</p>
				<p>Sadly, one common practice among burglars is to use social media to discover when a potential victim is on vacation. If your vacation status updates are publicly viewable, 
				rather than restricted to friend groups, then potential burglars can easily see when you are going to be away for an extended period of time.</p>
				<br>
				<p>5. Creation of fake profile</p>
			    <p>Creation of fake profile of a person and posting offensive content including morphed photographs on the fake profile</p>
				<br>
				<p>6. Fake online friendship</p>
			    <p>Developing online friendship over social media (with no real-life familiarity and using the emotional connect to trick you in transferring
				funds on some pretext such as medical emergency, legal troubles, problems in a foreign country etc.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Preventive Measures/Precautions</h3>
							
							<p>1.   Block profiles from public searches. </p>
							
							<p>2.	Restrict who can find you via online search.</p>
							
							<p>3.   Limit what people can learn about you through searching on net.</p>
							
							<p>4.   Log out after each session.</p>
							
							<p>5.   Don’t share social media credentials.</p>
							
							<p>6.   Don’t accept friend requests from unknowns.</p>
							
							<p>7.   Don’t click suspicious links.</p>
							
							<p>8.   Keep the privacy settings of your social media profile at the most restricted levels, esp. for public/others</p>
							
							<p>9.   Remember that information scattered over multiple posts, photographs, status, comments etc. may together reveal
							enough about you to enable a fraudster to steal your identity and defarud you. So, apply maximum caution while sharing anything online</p>
