<h1>CYBER BULLYING:</h1>
<h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
<p>
Cyberbullying is the harassment, taunting, impersonation, or other forms of unwanted attention through technology (cell phones, social media, etc.).

A rude comment on social media can quickly escalate into abuse as more people join in. A sext can be forwarded to an entire peer group in virtually no time at all. Preteens and teens get caught in the perfect storm of wanting social approval and spending a lot of time online, usually without adult supervision. In situations where a mature adult could block the offender and be done with it, young people can become overwhelmed by the onslaught of activity. Unfortunately, the self-worth of many young people is deeply connected to how their peers treat them. A social environment that is unfriendly, for example homophobic or transphobic, leaves members of the group vulnerable to abuse. Even before being cyberbullied, many teens are already be working hard to scrape together some self-esteem (Chen, 2010). People can tell when they are rejected, and it hurts.

Compounding these problems is a reticence to tell parents about bullying and cyberbullying. Targets may be afraid of losing Internet access, or undergoing further embarrassment. They may not trust their parents to actually help, and can fear parental involvement making things worse.</p>
<h2>The Role of Adults</h2>

<p>Too often, adults brush off the complaints of children and teens. When a scared young person seeks support with a boundary and is dismissed, she becomes more scared. The adult she comes to has a lot of power in these moments. To stand behind a young person, aligning to their most respect-worthy self, is to increase her strength. Being a good ally to the young people in our lives requires slowing down enough to notice those moments. How we handle kids reaching out to us for help has a huge effect on their lives.

The organization Kidpower does great work in this area, helping young people get the attention of the adults in matters of safety. This applies to emotional and physical safety. For example, students in the program are instructed to say the phrase, "This is about my safety" until they get the attention of an adult who will listen and help.

Training adults to slow down and notice when a child needs help, and training children to get the attention of adults, is a two-pronged approach to give kids the support they need.</p> 
<h2>The Effects of Cyberbullying</h2>

<p>When students are bullied online or offline, the school experience becomes one of humiliation. Young people usually don't get a choice about going to school, so when peers turn against them they can feel trapped. Parents who force students to attend school, where they are being abused, become part of the problem. Accepting harm can become the ‘new norm,' resulting in anxiety and depression.

Cyberbullying
When people's boundaries are repeatedly violated, they either become full of rage or anxious and self-critical. These are two results of being unable to hold one's space. Without the confidence and self-esteem that comes from healthy space-holding, students can easily become isolated. It is a short road to eating disorders, cutting, lashing out, and other acts of destruction.

Not everyone lives through the experience of being cyberbullied. Dozens of young people have killed themselves after being abused online (Broderick, 2013 & Tozer, 2013). One of the more famous cases is that of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers freshman whose roommate filmed him on a date with a man and broadcasted it publicly. Clementi jumped to his death from the Washington Bridge a few days later on September 22, 2010 (Pilkington, 2010 & Tyler Clementi Foundation, 2016).
