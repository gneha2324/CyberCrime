Cyber crimes can involve criminal activities that are traditional in nature, such as theft, fraud, forgery, defamation and mischief, all of which are subject to the Indian Penal Code. The abuse of computers has also given birth to a gamut of new age crimes that are addressed by the Information Technology Act, 2000.

We can categorize Cyber crimes in two ways:</br>
<ul>
</li>The Computer as a Target :-using a computer to attack other computers.
</br>
e.g. Hacking, Virus/Worm attacks, DOS attack etc. </li>
<li>The computer as a weapon :-using a computer to commit real world crimes.
</br>
e.g. Cyber Terrorism, IPR violations, Credit card frauds, EFT frauds, Pornography etc.
