<h1>ATM FRAUDS:</h1>
  
<p>Internet Banking Fraud is a fraud or theft committed using online technology to illegally remove money from a bank account and/or transfer money to an account in a different bank. Internet Banking Fraud is a form of identity theft and is usually made possible through techniques such as phishing.</p>
				<p>Major banks, such as HDFC Bank Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Federal Bank Ltd, recently sent out SMSs asking some customers to change the personal identification number (PIN) of their debit cards immediately. An SMS from a private bank to one such customer read, “With the spike in fraudulent transactions at ATMs in banks, your debit card ending XXXX could have been compromised. 
				To protect your account, we advise you to change your PIN immediately. You can change your PIN via Net Banking, Mobile Banking or at an ATM.”</p>
				<p>Here’s a look at different kinds of Net banking & ATM frauds out there.</p>
				<h2>•	Skimming and cloning</h2>
				<p>Bankers and security experts state that this is the most widely known form of fraud at ATMs. A card reader, which can extract all the information from the magnetic strip present on cards, is installed in the slot where you dip your card. A hacker will then transfer this information on to a duplicate card. In some cases, you will also find a fake keypad placed above the actual keypad. Once you enter the PIN, the machine will not show any response, making a user think that the system is malfunctioning. 
				However, the fake keypad would have copied the PIN you had entered.</p>
				<h2>•	Data theft</h2>
				<p>Data theft is a common way to con, especially at open ATM installation areas such as malls and shopping complexes where a person standing behind could try to distract you after you enter the PIN. Frauds also take place at point of sale (PoS) terminals, where payments are made to make a purchase. 
				Experts say that such frauds can take place at restaurants, shops and other merchant outlets.</p>
				<h2>•	Phishing</h2>
				<p>A person's personal details are obtained by fraudsters posing as bankers, who float a site similar to that of the person's bank. They are asked to provide all personal information about themselves and their account to the bank on the pretext of database upgradation. 
				The number and password are then used to carry out transactions on their behalf without their knowledge.</p>
				<h2>•	Spam</h2>
				<p>Spam is an electronic 'junk mail' or unwanted messages sent to your email account or mobile phone. These messages vary, but are essentially commercial and often annoying in their sheer volume. They may try to persuade you to buy a product or service, or visit a website where you can make purchases; or they may attempt to trick you into divulging your bank account or credit card details</p>
				<h2>•	Spyware</h2>
				<p>Spyware such as Trojan Horse is generally considered to be software that is secretly installed on a computer and takes things from it without the permission or knowledge of the user. Spyware may take personal information, business information, bandwidth; or processing capacity and secretly gives it to someone else.  </p>

				<h3>Secure Net-Banking Tips</h3>

<p>•	If you get a transaction slip, shred it immediately after use if not needed.<p>

<p>•	If your ATM card is lost or stolen, report it to your bank immediately<p>

<p>•	When you deposit a cheque or card into your ATM, check the credit entry in your account after a
 couple of days. If there is any discrepancy, report it to your bank.<p>

<p>•	Register your mobile number with the Bank to get alerts for your transactions<p>

<p>•	If your card gets stuck in the ATM, or if cash is not dispensed after you keying in a transaction, call your bank immediately<p>

<p>•	If you have any complaint about your ATM/Debit/Credit card transaction at an ATM, you must take it up with the bank<p>


<br></br>

<p>o	4 digit ATM/IVR PIN<p>
<p>o	OTP<p>
<p>o	Net Banking password<p>
<p>o	CVV (Card Verification Value)<p>

<p>•	Ensure that no one sees you entering you PIN (personal identification number).<p>

<p>•	Avoid giving verification details to the Phone Banking officer while in public places.<p>

<p>•	The Phone Banking channel is meant to be used by the account holder only. Do not transfer the line or hand over the
 phone to any other person after you complete self-authentication.<p>
