<h1>HACKING:</h1>
  
<h1>What is hacking?</h1>
<p>Hacking is the art of exploiting computers to get access to otherwise unauthorised information. Now that the world is using IT systems to gather, store and manipulate important information there is also a need to make sure that data is secure.

Ethical hacking is the use of programming skills to determine weak spots or vulnerabilities latent in a computer system. The world of hacking is divided based on intent. Non-ethical hackers, or “black hats”, will use their skills to exploit the vulnerable spots of a computer network to promote mischief or to tamper with confidential information for personal gain or other reasons. To combat the influx of computer-based crimes and the tampering of sensitive information, ethical hackers, or “white hats”, evaluate computer systems to point out vulnerable spots (the entry points for “black hats”) of a computer system and subsequently reinforce them through the delivery of advanced technologies or improvements.

Ethical hacking is grouped into the somewhat ambiguous definition of “hacking” because the practice requires the use of advanced computer knowledge to, in some way, penetrate a computer system. Ethical hacking is considered legal because the actions are used to increase the security of a computer system. Ethical hacking requires the breaking of a system to pinpoint vulnerable areas and to promote reinforcement. The theory behind ethical hacking is that if a white hat can break a computer system, then a black hat can use the same points of entry to promote illegal activity.
</p>
<h1>Who is Hacker?</h1>
<p>A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem.</br>

While “hacker” can refer to any computer programmer, the term has become associated in popular culture with a “security hacker“, someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems.</p>
</br>
<h1>Types of hacker</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<dt style="font-family:verdana;">Script Kiddie:</dt>
<dd style="font-family:verdana;">Script Kiddies normally don’t care about hacking.They copy code and use it for a virus or an SQLi or something else.Script Kiddies will never hack for themselves; they’ll just download overused software (LOIC or Metasploit, for example) and watch a YouTube video on how to use it.A common Script Kiddie attack is DoSing or DDoSing (Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service), in which they flood an IP with so much information it collapses under the strain.
This attack is frequently used by the “hacker” group Anonymous, which doesn’t help anyone’s reputation.</dd>
</li>
<li>
<dt style="font-family:verdana;">White Hat</dt>
<dd style="font-family:verdana;">Also known as ethical hackers, White Hat hackers are the good guys of the hacker world.They’ll help you remove a virus or Pen Test a company.Most White Hat hackers hold a college degree in IT security or computer science and must be certified to pursue a career in hacking.The most popular certification is the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) from the EC-Council.</dd></li>
<li>
<dt style="font-family:verdana;">Black Hat</dt>
<dd style="font-family:verdana;">Black hats are the bad guys: the malicious hackers or crackers who use their skills for illegal or malicious purposes. They break into or otherwise violate the system integrity of remote systems, with malicious intent. Having gained unauthorized access, black-hat hackers destroy vital data, deny legitimate users service, and just cause problems for their targets. Black-hat hackers and crackers can easily be differentiated from white-hat hackers because their actions are malicious. This is the traditional definition of a hacker and what most people consider a hacker to be.</dd>
</li>
<li>
<dt style="font-family:verdana;">Gray Hat</dt>
<dd style="font-family:verdana;">Nothing is ever just black or white; the same is true in the world of hacking.Gray Hat hackers don’t steal money or information (although, sometimes they deface a website or two), yet they don’t help people for good (but, they could if they wanted to).
These hackers comprise most of the hacking world, even though Black Hat hackers garner most (if not all) of the media’s attention.</dd>
</li>
</dl></ul>
<h1>Scope of Ethical Hacking</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ethical hacking is a crucial component of risk assessment, auditing, couterfraud, best practices, and good governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It s used to identify risks and highlight the remedial actions and also reduces information and communications technology (ICT) costs by resolving those vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Limitations</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
However, unless the businesses first know what it is at that they are looking for and Why they are hiring an outside vendor to hack systems in the first place, chances are there would not be much to gain from experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An ethical hacker thus can only help the organization to better understand their security system, but it is up to the organization to place the right guard on the network.</p>
